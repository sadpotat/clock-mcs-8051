# A digital clock using mcs-8051
 This is a project I did for my Microprocessor and Assembly Language Programming Lab course. It's a 6-digit display clock.
 
 See calculations.txt for how machine cycles are used to count time here.
 
 Load 6_clock.hex into the AT89C51 model in proteus before running the simulation.
